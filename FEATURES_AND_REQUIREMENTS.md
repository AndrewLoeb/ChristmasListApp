**So that** I can access my personal list and view family members' lists

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Dropdown displays all registered family members
- Password field validates against stored password
- Successful login displays welcome message with user's name
- Failed login shows error message "Check Password."
- Empty password shows "Enter Password" message
- Login state persists during session

**Current Implementation:**
- Component: `Login.razor`
- Service: `googleSheetsListService.Users_GetList()`
- Data: Users sheet (ID, Family, Name, Password, Notes)
- Validation: Client-side password comparison (line 87)

**Recent Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ "Remember Me" functionality implemented (commit 41e21fa)
- ‚úÖ LocalStorageService added for persistent login

## Technical Requirements

### TR-001: Google Sheets Integration
**Current State:**
- SpreadsheetId: `1vlS_UM0fCKAWPNxix8C2POwrcH3YTTdSpYQZWeDeG0k`
- Sheets: "Users", "Items"
- Authentication: OAuth2 with `app_client_secret.json`

**Requirements:**
- Read/write access to Google Sheets API v4
- Service account or OAuth credentials
- Error handling for API failures
- Rate limiting considerations

**Refactor Considerations:**
- Abstract data layer to support multiple backends
- Add caching to reduce API calls
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Add connection health checks

---

### TR-002: Data Models

#### UserModel
```csharp
public class UserModel {
    int Id
    string Family
    string Name
    string Password
    string Notes
}
```

**Refactor Needs:**
- Separate authentication concerns from user profile
- Add created/updated timestamps
- Add email field for future notifications
- Consider role-based access (admin, user)

---

#### ItemModel
```csharp
public class ItemModel {
    int ItemId
    string Name        // Owner's name
    string Item        // Item description
    string Link        // Product URL
    string Notes       // Item notes
    string DateUpdated // Last modified
    string Claimer     // Who claimed it
    string DateClaimed // When claimed
    int Active         // Soft delete flag (1=active, 0=deleted)

    // Product metadata (added commit 737ef6d)
    string ImageUrl           // Product image from OpenGraph/Google Image Search
    decimal? Price            // Nullable - may not always have price
    string MetadataFetchedDate // When metadata was last scraped
}
```

**Recent Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ ImageUrl field added for product images
- ‚úÖ Price field added (nullable decimal)
- ‚úÖ MetadataFetchedDate tracks freshness

**Refactor Needs:**
- Dates should be DateTime, not string (deferred - see "Won't Do" in REFACTOR_BACKLOG.md)
- Add CreatedDate separate from DateUpdated (low priority)
- Add category/tags (future enhancement)
- Add priority level (future enhancement)
- Consider foreign key pattern for Name/Claimer (would require DB migration)

---

#### ListModel
```csharp
public class ListModel {
    List<ItemModel> List
    string Name
    int itemsListed
    int itemsClaimed
    DateTime lastUpdated
    string dropDownStr  // Computed display string
}
```

**Refactor Needs:**
- dropDownStr shouldn't be in model (presentation concern)
- Add computed properties properly
- Consider separating view model from domain model

---

### TR-003: Service Layer Architecture

**Current Services:**
- `googleSheetsListService` - Main CRUD operations, retry logic with exponential backoff
- `allListsService` - Global state cache (scoped), bulk data loading
- `userIdService` - Session state (scoped)
- `ProductMetadataService` - OpenGraph scraping, orchestrates image search (commit ee6c781)
- `GoogleImageSearchService` - Google Custom Search API integration (commit 87102af)
- `LocalStorageService` - Browser localStorage for "Remember Me" (commit 41e21fa)
- `googleSheetsSpiceService` - Secondary spreadsheet (legacy, appears unused)

**Refactor Strategy:**
1. **Repository Pattern**
   - `IUserRepository`, `IItemRepository`
   - `GoogleSheetsUserRepository`, `GoogleSheetsItemRepository`
   - Allow for future SQL/NoSQL implementations

2. **Service Layer**
   - `IListService` - Business logic
   - `IAuthenticationService` - Login/session
   - `INotificationService` - Toasts/alerts

3. **State Management**
   - Consider Fluxor or similar for Blazor state
   - Move away from shared service state
   - Implement proper caching strategy

---

### TR-004: Component Architecture

**Previous Pattern (Removed):**
- `Login.razor` - Base component with state
- `MyList.razor` - Inherited Login
- `ListReview.razor` - Inherited Login
- `MyGifts.razor` - Inherited Login

**Current Pattern (Refactored - commit 15c2b8c):**
- ‚úÖ Component inheritance removed
- ‚úÖ Shared state via service injection (`userIdService`, `allListsService`)
- ‚úÖ Independent, reusable components
- ‚úÖ Separation of concerns maintained

**Future Considerations:**
- Cascading parameters for user context (optional improvement)
- AuthenticationStateProvider pattern (optional for enterprise patterns)

---

### TR-005: Security Requirements

**Current Gaps:**
- Plain text passwords
- No HTTPS enforcement
- No CSRF protection

- No rate limiting on login
- Google Sheets credentials in codebase
- No audit logging

**Recent Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Credentials moved to configuration (commit ce3b34a)
- ‚úÖ Input validation and sanitization implemented (commit 06004b6)

**Refactor Priorities (Updated):**
1. **DEFERRED**: Hash passwords - Intentional decision for family app (see REFACTOR_BACKLOG.md "Won't Do")
2. **MEDIUM**: Add HTTPS redirect
3. **MEDIUM**: CSRF tokens for forms
4. **MEDIUM**: Rate limiting on login
5. **LOW**: Two-factor authentication
6. **LOW**: Password reset flow
7. **LOW**: Azure Key Vault / AWS Secrets (currently environment variables sufficient)

---

### TR-006: UI/UX Requirements

- Enhanced keyboard shortcuts (low priority)

---

### TR-007: Data Synchronization

**Current Challenges:**
- Multiple users editing simultaneously
- Google Sheets as single source of truth
- No real-time updates
- Optimistic UI updates can desync
- Manual state management in components

**Refactor Strategy:**
1. Implement SignalR for real-time updates
2. Add optimistic concurrency control
3. Implement proper cache invalidation
4. Add conflict resolution strategy
5. Consider moving to proper database

---

### TR-008: Error Handling

   - Critical paths (login, add item, claim)

4. **Test Infrastructure**
   - xUnit or NUnit
   - bUnit for Blazor components
   - Moq for mocking
   - Playwright or Selenium for E2E

---

### TR-010: Performance Optimization

**Previous Issues (Resolved):**
- ~~Full data fetch on every component load~~ ‚Üí ‚úÖ Bulk loading at login (commit 7e947e8)
- ~~Repeated API calls~~ ‚Üí ‚úÖ 90% reduction via allListsService caching

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Bulk data loading (commit 7e947e8)
- ‚úÖ allListsService caching (scoped, one fetch per session)
- ‚úÖ Optimistic UI updates (immediate feedback)
- ‚úÖ Conflict detection prevents stale data issues

**Optimization Opportunities:**
1. Add pagination for large lists (low priority - family lists rarely exceed 50 items)
2. Lazy load images (low priority - product images are optimized)
3. Enable response compression (optional)
4. Add CDN for static assets (optional for family app)
5. Implement service worker for offline (low priority - online-only app)
