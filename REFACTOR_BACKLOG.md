# Refactor Backlog

This is your working list of improvements and refactoring tasks. Add, remove, and reorder items as priorities change.

---

## ðŸ”¥ High Priority

- [x] **Bulk load data from backend** - Speed up site by loading all items at once
- [x] **Add delete confirmations** - Prevent accidental item deletion (MyList.razor:157-161)
- [x] **Fix typo in method name** - `GetAllItmes` â†’ `GetAllItems` (MyGifts.razor:34, service method)
- [x] **Add error handling** - Show user-friendly messages when Google Sheets API fails

## ðŸ“‹ Medium Priority

- [x] **OpenGraph URL scraping** - Auto-populate item images from product links (Amazon requires PA-API - see Feature Enhancements)
- [x] **Add Cancel buttons** - Allow users to exit edit mode without saving (My List items & notes). Only edit one item at a time
- [x] **Add input validation** - Validate URLs, check for empty item names, character limits
- [x] **Improve mobile responsiveness** - Fix card-columns layout issues in ListReview
- [x] **Move Google Sheets credentials** - Extract hardcoded SpreadsheetId to configuration
- [x] **Remove component inheritance** - Refactor Login/MyList/ListReview/MyGifts to use proper patterns

## ðŸ”§ Low Priority / Nice to Have
- [ ] **Manual refresh button for product metadata** - Add icon/button to re-fetch images for individual items
- [ ] **Admin page for batch product info refresh** - Update all legacy items with missing metadata
- [ ] **Manual price field** - Let users enter product prices for budget tracking

## ðŸ’¡ Feature Enhancements

- [ ] **Amazon PA-API integration** - Get product images and prices from Amazon (requires Associate account with sales)
- [ ] **Manual price entry field** - Allow users to manually enter prices when auto-detection fails
- [ ] **Budget tracking** - Sum up prices, show spending totals per person
- [ ] **Search and filter** - Find items quickly in List Review
- [ ] **Item categories/tags** - Organize items by type (books, electronics, etc.)

## Won't Do (For Now)

- **Fix password security** - Hash passwords instead of plain text. Decision: Keep plain text for family app, maintain manual access via Google Sheets. May revisit later.
- **Fix date types** - Change DateUpdated/DateClaimed from string to DateTime. Decision: Data is loaded as text from Google Sheets; changing types would require data migration and risk breaking existing data. Current string format works fine for display purposes.
- **Email notifications** - Notify when items are claimed/unclaimed
- **Add pagination** - For lists with many items
- **Add dark mode** - Theme toggle support
